#This is solution how to fix no splash screen in Ubuntu after nvidia proprietary driver installation. It's no matter what Ubuntu version you use, it should work anyway.

Open your terminal and type

sudo apt-get install v86d

Then

sudo pluma /etc/default/grub

Find this line

#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480
and change for this one (of course choose your resolution)

GRUB_GFXMODE=1440x900x24          /  1024x768-24
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep

Save file and type in terminal

echo FRAMEBUFFER=y | sudo tee /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash
sudo update-initramfs -u
sudo update-grub2

It's worked for me in all Ubuntu versions.
Give it a try :)
